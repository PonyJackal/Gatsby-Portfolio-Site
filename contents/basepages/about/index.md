I am Michael Wu from Japan, graduated from University of San Francisco with Bachelor degree of Computer Science.
I've been in web development over the last 7 years and my most expertise has been in Ruby on Rails, Node js and PHP for the backend and React, Angular for the frontend as well.

I started my full time job at Niku in CA where I worked as a Full Stack developer especially in MERN stack.

After that, I decided to back to Japan since I realized that Japanese has its culture.
In Osaka, I worked at HLC Japan Osaka Office where I mainly worked as a Ruby on Rails developer for the backend and web services as well as REST APIs.
In those days, I've refined my strength in DevOPs, where I provided solutions in database technology, programming and operating systems.

Since I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside of my comfort and knowledge set, I left HLC and started my carear as a freelancer on Upwork.

Simply it is all about new challenges and opportunities to grow up myself as a developer and a human being.

To be honest, it was big days for the first 1-3 months on Upwork,
But it was really worth working for and I never regret my choices.

I brought sucess in small and medium sized companies as well as individual clients by building MVPs and solving urgent tasks for presentations and chances which took much in their growth.

Taking a look at clients' face full of pleasure and hearing their voice full of satisfaction and thankful as well made everything worth working for.

This is what I always proud of myself and I feel confident about new challenges and feel lucky to have an opportunity to make me better.

For now, I am full of beans and energy, as a people person and team player,  I really want nice teammates and long term relationship so that we are going through thicks and thins, and I can't wait to join you to solve problems, bring sucess and improve myself as well.
