I am Yarosalv from Kyiv, senior MERN stack expert with 5 years fo practical experience.
After I graduated from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv as Bachelor of Science, I started to work for Luxoft in Kyiv.
I've walked through tons of various range of projects in many stacks including MERN, LAMP, MEAN, MEVN and Laravel/Vue , .NET CORE/Angular.
As a big fan of FaceBook Tech, I mainly focused on React for the frontend and GraphQL for the APIs as well as Express for the backend and APIs for web and mobile apps.
Since React Native is strong enough to build hybrid mobile apps in React, I really love to use RN for mobile app development for both Android and iOS.
I can say I live and breathe with functional components with React Hooks and GraphQL which makes developer life much easier.

Since I've faced and counted various SMS , Voice and Video conference project, I eventually become the Twilio Expert who can manage Twilio programmable SMS/Voice/Video/TWIML/Webhook as well as Twilio Studio for IVR and Twilio Flex for customer support.
This makes me feel confident in everything related to such things like SMS, Voice and Video conference and rooms.

I always keep those things in my mind when I build apps for the client.
"Always make haste with best quality"
"Keep positive attitude and always find the client's satisfaction first"
