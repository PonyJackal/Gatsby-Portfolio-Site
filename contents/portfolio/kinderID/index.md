KinderID is a Norwegian safety solution that helps you reunite with your lost children or misplaced items. Perfect for travelling, excursions or in a hectic daily life. I worked as a React/React Native developer.
I maily focused on optimization of performance of the React funcitonal components and Express api integration using useActon.
